    A new configuration option ``enforce_new_defaults`` has been
    added to the ``[oslo_policy]`` group to control whether or not to
    use the old deprecated defaults. If ``True``, the old deprecated
    defaults are not going to be evaluated which mean if any existing
    token allowed for old defaults but disallowed for new defaults
    will be disallowed. It is encouraged to enable this flag along
    with ``enforce_scope`` flag so that you can get benefits of new
    defaults and ``scope_type`` together. This way operators can switch
    to new defaults without overwriting the rule in policy file.
